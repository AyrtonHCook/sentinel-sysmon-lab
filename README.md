# Microsoft Sentinel Lab: Sysmon & Security Logs

**Goal:** Ingest and analyse Windows Security + Sysmon logs in Microsoft Sentinel.  
**Skills Gained:** Log collection with AMA, KQL query writing, detection engineering.

---

## Overview
This lab collects logs from a Windows 10 VM into Sentinel.  
I created custom KQL rules to detect process creation anomalies, encoded PowerShell, and suspicious child processes.

---

## Quick Start
```kql
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4688
| where CommandLine contains "-enc"
```

---

## Results
- Logs ingested successfully via AMA + Sysmon.  
- Detected encoded PowerShell and anomalous process chains.
